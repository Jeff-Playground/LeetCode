Reliability:
    Fault-tolerant:
        Hardware faults:
            Add redundancy
        Software errors:
            Carefully thinking about assumptions and interactions in the systems
            Thorough testing
            Process isolation
            Allowing processes to crash and restart
            Measuring, monitoring and analyzing system behaviour in production
        Human errors:
            Design systems in a way that minimizes opportunities for error
            Decouple the places where people make the most mistakes from the places where they can cause failures
            Test thoroughly at all levels, from unit tests to whole-system integration tests and manual tests
            Allow quick and easy recovery from human errors, to minimize the impact in the case of a failure
            Set up detailed and clear monitoring, such as performance metrics and error rates(telemetry)
            Implement good management practices and training
