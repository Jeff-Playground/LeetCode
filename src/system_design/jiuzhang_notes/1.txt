    Design Twitter as an example:
    Pull model: too many DB reads for followers, can be solved by using cache
    Push model(Fan-out): for celebrity with too many followers, the fan-out would take too long for some followers, can
                         be optimized by adding more machines doing fan-out
    Both models can be combined, for celebrities use pull, while for others push
