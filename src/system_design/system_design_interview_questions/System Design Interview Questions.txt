Scalability Lecture
Scalability Lecture by David Malan, Harvard Web Development

Vertical scaling:
    there's a ceiling
    single point of failure

Horizontal scaling:
    Distribute the requests with a load balancer
    Load Balancer:
        Random
        Least loaded
        Session/cookies
        Round-robin/Weighted round-robin
        Layer 4
        Layer 7
    RAID
    Sticky sessions:
        Store session info in load balancer server or a standalone server
        Store server info in the cookie(a uuid or a random number), load balancer maintains the mapping for this info to servers
    Data replication:
        active-passive
        active-active
    Data partitioning
    Load balancing based on geographic location(DNS level):
        Redirection happens when TTL expires
    Security:
        80(TCP) and 443(SSL) from external, 80(TCP) only inside, 3306(TCP) to databases


Problem Approach:
Feature expectations ( First 2 mins )
Estimations ( 2-5 mins )
Design Goals ( 1 mins )
Skeleton of the design ( 4 - 5 mins )
Deep dive ( 20-30 mins )
