Consistency over availability:
Still needs sharding to handle big amount of data, but for each sharding node, instead of doing peer-to-peer, we have a master-master design, where
transaction log is stored on a shared network file system. In the case of a node failure, the standby master would sync based on the transaction log
and start handling request.
