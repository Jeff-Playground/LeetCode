An Euler path is a path that uses every edge of a graph exactly once.
An Euler path both starts with and ends with a node which has odd number of in plus out degrees.
To find a euler path, just iterate over all out edges for a starting node, and after the loop note down the node, beware
the final path generated is in reversed order.
