Union find can be used to identify whether there are cycles in a graph.
Use an int array group to store the group info for nodes, and another int array rank to store the level of nodes in
the graph. Union find should support add, find and union. Note the union logic need to be written with care to avoid
cycles.

The related optimizations are:
    - Path compression, where time complexity for Find, Union and Connected all becomes O(logN)
    - Union by rank to aim for a more balanced graph/tree, where time complexity for Find, Union and Connected all becomes
      O(logN)

Note when the above 2 optimizations are combined, the time complexity for Find, Union and Connected all becomes O(α(N)),
where α refers to the Inverse Ackermann function. In practice, we assume it's a constant. In other words, O(α(N)) is
regarded as O(1) on average.

    private class UnionFind{
        int[] root, rank;

        public UnionFind(int l){
            root=new int[l];
            rank=new int[l];
            for(int i=0; i<l; i++){
                root[i]=i;
                rank[i]=1;
            }
        }

        public int find(int x){
            if(root[x]!=x){
                root[x]=find(root[x]);
            }
            return root[x];
        }

        public void union(int x, int y){
            int rx=find(x), ry=find(y);
            if(rx!=ry){
                if(rank[rx]>rank[ry]){
                    root[ry]=rx;
                } else if(rank[rx]<rank[ry]){
                    root[rx]=ry;
                } else{
                    root[rx]=ry;
                    rank[ry]++;
                }
            }
        }
    }


Note Kruskal's algorithm use UnionFind to determine whether a new edge creates a cycle in the connected graph.
