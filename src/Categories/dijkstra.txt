Used for one to many minimum path.
Use a PriorityQueue to do BFS like search.
Use one dimensional array: int[] last, to track the last node of the shortest path, because there's only one source, not
necessary to use two dimensional array
Use a Map or an array to store the current minimum path length to each node.
