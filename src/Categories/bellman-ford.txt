Used for one to many minimum path.
Iterate over the all the give edges to search and relax the minimum length to reach each node.
Use one dimensional array: int[] last, to track the last node of the shortest path, because there's only one source, not
necessary to use two dimensional array.
The normal relaxing of the nodes takes N-1 times, where N is the number of nodes. Because this is the minimum number of
edges required to form a connected acyclic graph(tree). To determine whether there's a negative loop, just try relaxing
one more time, and if it succeeded, it means there's a negative loop.
