Used to identify whether a directed graph is strongly connected. The idea is to start from one vertex, and do DFS to check
if it can reach all other vertices; then start from the same vertex but reverse all edges and do DFS again to see if it can
reach all other vertices. The logic is this checks whether a vertex can reach all other vertices, and whether all other
vertices can reach this vertex.
