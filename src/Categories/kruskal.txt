Used for finding the minimum spanning tree in a weighted undirected graph.

The general idea is:
1. sort all the available edges in a graph based on their length
2. pick the current minimum edge and add it to the minimum spanning tree if adding this edge doesn't form a circle in the
   tree
3. repeat 2 until there're n-1 edges added, where n is the number of vertices in the graph

To check whether there's a circle in the current minimum spanning tree(MST), we can use a UnionFind.
To sort the edges, we can use a PriorityQueue.

The difference between Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm is that Kruskal's algo expands the MST by adding edges.
Whereas Primâ€™s algorithm expands the MST by adding vertices.
