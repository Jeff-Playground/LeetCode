Done in recursions, in each recursion:
    Get the first element(index 0) and store it in a separate variable temp;
    Maintain two pointers lesser and greater, lesser starts from 0 and greater starts from the end;
    Start with greater and keep doing greater-- until there's an element lesser than (note NO OR EQUAL TO) temp, put it
    in position lesser
    Start with lesser and keep doing lesser++ until there's an element greater than (note NO OR EQUAL TO) temp, put it
    in position greater
    Keep doing this until lesser==greater, now put temp in position lesser
    Now everything before lesser is less than OR EQUAL TO temp, and everything after lesser is greater than OR EQUAL TO
    temp
    Start two new recursions for the part before lesser and the other after lesser
