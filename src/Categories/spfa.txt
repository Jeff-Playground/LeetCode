Used for one to many minimum path, note this can also handle graph with negative edges.
Optimized bellman-ford, iterate over the all the given edges to search and relax the minimum length to reach each node.
The difference is it uses a Queue to store current reached nodes, so the edge iteration can be more targeted.
Use one dimensional array: int[] last, to track the last node of the shortest path, because there's only one source, not
necessary to use two dimensional array.
Use one dimensional array: int[] count to store the times that each node is relaxed, if it's >N, then there's a negative
loop. Because a node can be relaxed by any other nodes in the graph, and there are N-1 nodes apart from the node being
relaxed. So if a node is relaxed more than (N-1) times, it means there has to be at least one other node used more than
once, so there is a negative loop. Also note use N instead of (N-1) to handle the case when there's only one node(N==1)
